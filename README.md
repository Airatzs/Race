# Race

The simplest game ever imaginable on C# WinForms :)

Dodge oncoming cars using WASD and earn points! The game is over when you hit an enemy car.

It's basically a set of moving pictures (.png files changing their coordinates on your screen),
with a set of audios and some gifs.

The project is ready to be compiled or released and executed, everything should run smoothly, although it's not optimized.
